## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Doc-Assist-Pro seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please follow these steps:

1. **Email us** at [security@doc-assist-pro.com](mailto:security@doc-assist-pro.com) with subject line: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report`

2. **Include detailed information**:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Affected versions
   - Any proposed solutions if available

3. **Encryption**: If needed, encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security@doc-assist-pro.com)

### What to Expect

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 24 hours | Acknowledgment of your report |
| 72 hours | Initial assessment and severity classification |
| 7-14 days | Detailed investigation and validation |
| 30-90 days | Patch development and security release (based on severity) |

### Severity Ratings

We assess vulnerabilities based on the following criteria:

- **Critical**: Direct exposure of sensitive patient data, unauthorized administrative access
- **High**: Authentication bypass, significant data exposure vulnerabilities, injection attacks
- **Medium**: Cross-site scripting, limited data exposure
- **Low**: Minor issues with limited security impact

### Recognition

We believe in acknowledging security researchers who help keep our platform secure:

- Security researchers will be credited in our security advisories (with permission)
- Our Hall of Fame highlights researchers who have reported significant vulnerabilities
- We do not currently offer a bug bounty program, but we provide recognition and appropriate acknowledgment

## Disclosure Policy

Doc-Assist-Pro follows a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy:

1. **Discovery**: Security researchers discover and report vulnerabilities
2. **Verification**: Our security team validates the issue
3. **Remediation**: We develop and test fixes
4. **Notification**: We notify customers about the issue and available patches
5. **Disclosure**: Public disclosure after adequate time for customer updates

### Disclosure Timeline

| Stage | Timeframe | Actions |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Initial** | 0 days | Vulnerability report received |
| **Validation** | 3-7 days | Issue confirmed and severity assessed |
| **Remediation** | 7-90 days | Fix developed (timeframe based on severity) |
| **Customer Notification** | Prior to public disclosure | Private advisory to customers with mitigation steps |
| **Public Disclosure** | After customer patch window | Public security advisory published |

We may adjust this timeline based on:
- Vulnerability severity and exploitability
- Complexity of the fix
- Coordination with third-party vendors
- Evidence of active exploitation
